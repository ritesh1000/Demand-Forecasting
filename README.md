# Demand-Forecasting

We have a Superstore dataset, having data from 2014 to 2017. Shows the product sold daily throughout US region. Need to forecast future demand of product for 2018 and 2019 i.e. upcoming 24 months.

Resampling done with resample() function so data changed with Monthly Frequency.

Applied Rolling statistics, that shows constant Mean and constant Standard Daviation. So it is a Stationary Dataset.
